This is my Vim config.

Some plugins may require python enabled with vim. If so, start by checking that python is available with `vim --version`. If not enabled on your machine, need to recompile vim:

cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git && cd vim
./configure --enable-pythoninterp --prefix=/usr
make && sudo make install

Remember to add /usr/bin to $PATH (in such a way to give precedent to the newly compiled vim.)

Rather than dealing with git submodules to keep packages up-to-date with git and Vundle, I simply remember to delete the .git files from each package bundle before commiting this repo. Deleting these submodule .git files results in errors thrown every time you try to run :PluginInstall, but they are safe to ignore.
