This is my Vim config.

To use it, clone this repo to your `$HOME` directory where vim looks for user-specific configuration files.

I use Vundle plugin manager to install the plugins specified in `vimrc`. To install these, open up vim and `:PluginInstall`. Vundle will fetch the plugins it finds from github so that they are available for use.
